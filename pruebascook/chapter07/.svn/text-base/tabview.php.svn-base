Moodle (abbreviation for Modular Object-Oriented
Dynamic Learning Environment) is a free and open-source
e-learning
software platform, also known as a Course Management
System, Learning
Management System, or Virtual Learning Environment
(VLE). As of
October 2010 it had a user base of 49,952 registered
and verified
sites, serving 37 million users in 3.7 million courses.

Martin Dougiamas, who has graduate degrees in computer
science and
education, wrote the first version of Moodle. Dougiamas
started a
Ph.D. to examine "The use of Open Source software to
support a
social constructionist epistemology of teaching and
learning
within Internet-based communities of reflective
inquiry". Although
how exactly social constructionism makes Moodle
different from other
eLearning platforms is difficult to show, it has been
cited as an
important factor by Moodle adopters. Other Moodle
adopters,
such as the Open University in the UK, have pointed out
that Learning
Management Systems can equally be seen as "relatively
pedagogy-neutral"

The acronym Moodle stands for Modular Object-Oriented
Dynamic Learning
Environment (in the early years the "M" stood for
"Martin's", named after
Martin Dougiamas, the original developer). As well as
being an acronym,
the name was chosen because of the dictionary
definition of Moodle
and to correspond to an available domain name.
